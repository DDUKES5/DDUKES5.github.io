About:
	
   Hello! my name is Devaughn Dukes in from Atlanta Georgia. I have 2 sisters and 2 brothers, DeAshia, Desiree, Andre, and Zachery. I grew up in clayton county in a small apartment. I went to McGarrah elementary school. As a child I didn’t like school very much because I had to wake up early and be around people I didn’t know. Once I got familiar with my classmate I enjoyed interacting with my peers. I remember learning a lot however I didn’t like do the assignment this lead to poor grades. When my mother would come in for parent teacher conferences my teacher would let her I would socialized with the other student but I wound do my work. Then they suggested I get though one on one with the teacher thinking my issue was learning the material. This went on for about two weeks and the teacher realized I know the subject I just wouldn’t do my work.
		
   In 3rd grade we move to Dekalb county, if you don’t know this area has a higher crime rate. We move for this apartment to a house in this area. I was excited to have more room and a backyard, until I found out I had to cut it. We moved are things into the house while the current home owners where moving out. Then one day my mother told me our stuff was stolen. This was like our welcome to the neighborhood introduction. This open my eyes to people in this different area.
		
   Fast forward to high school I moved to Rockdale county. I went to Rockdale County High school from 2010 through 2014. This pivotal moment of my life really shaped who I am today. I really started to focus on school and working. I worked with my father’s trucking company moving furniture and packaging. I did this for about 2 and a half years, then I work with my uncle making pizzas, wings and salads.
